    <book_description><![CDATA[A brilliant thriller from the author of the acclaimed Good Thief's Guide series asks, how can a beautiful woman simply vanish?<br /><br />When Rob Hale wakes up in a hospital after a motorcycle crash, his first thought is for the gorgeous blonde, Lena, who was on the back of his bike. The doctors and police, however, insist that he was alone at the scene. The shock of the accident must have made him imagine Lena, especially since his description of her resembles his late sister, Laura.<br /><br />Convinced that Lena is as real as he is, Rob teams up with Rebecca Lewis, a London-based PI who has a mysterious connection to Laura—and learns that even a close-knit community like the Isle of Man can hide dangerous secrets that will not stay safe forever.<br /><br /><a href="http://us.macmillan.com/safehouse/ChrisEwan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://us.macmillan.com/safehouse/Chr...</a>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<div>
  <div>Bletchley Park was where one of the war's most famous and crucial achievements was made: the cracking of Germany's Enigma code in which its most important military communications were couched. This country house was home to Britain's most brilliant mathematical brains, like Alan Turing, and the scene of immense advances in technologyindeed, the birth of modern computing. The military codes deciphered there were instrumental in turning both the Battle of the Atlantic and the war in North Africa. But, though plenty has been written about the scientists and the codebreaking, fictional and non-fictionfrom Robert Harris and Ian McEwan to Andrew Hodges' biography of Turingwhat of the thousands of men and women who lived and worked there during the war? The first history for the general reader of life at Bletchley Park, this is also an amazing compendium of memories from people now in their eighties of skating on the frozen lake in the grounds (a depressed Angus Wilson, the novelist, once threw himself in), of a youthful Roy Jenkinsuseless at codebreaking, of the high jinks at nearby accommodation hostels, and of the implacable secrecy that meant girlfriend and boyfriend working in adjacent huts knew nothing about each other's work.</div>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Soon to be a major motion picture!<br /><br />The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. <em>World War Z</em> is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.<br /><br /> Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. <br /><br /> Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, “By excluding the human factor, aren’t we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn’t the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as ‘the living dead’?”<br /><br /> Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.<br /><br /><br /> Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war<br /><br /> “I found ‘Patient Zero’ behind the locked door of an abandoned apartment across town. . . . His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine. Although he’d rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood. There was also no blood on his other wounds. . . . He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls. At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was ‘cursed.’ I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy’s skin was . . . cold and gray . . . I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse.” —Dr. Kwang Jingshu, Greater Chongqing, United Federation of China<br /><br /><br /> “‘Shock and Awe’? Perfect name. . . . But what if the enemy can’t be shocked and awed? Not just won’t, but biologically can’t! That’s what happened that day outside New York City, that’s the failure that almost lost us the whole damn war. The fact that we couldn’t shock and awe Zack boomeranged right back in our faces and actually allowed Zack to shock and awe us! They’re not afraid! No matter what we do, no matter how many we kill, they will never, ever be afraid!” —Todd Wainio, former U.S. Army infantryman and veteran of the Battle of Yonkers<br /><br /><br /> “Two hundred million zombies. Who can even visualize that type of number, let alone combat it? . . . For the first time in history, we faced an enemy that was actively waging total war. They had no limits of endurance. They would never negotiate, never surrender. They would fight until the very end because, unlike us, every single one of them, every second of every day, was devoted to consuming all life on Earth.” —General Travis D’Ambrosia, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Half of the charm of the Mr. Men is the illustration style. In the main, the Mr. Men are of pleasing shape and colour - they're solid, cheerful and they look like you could give any of them a nice big hug.<br /><br />Despite the flat two dimensional nature of the drawings it's often easy to envisage the Mr. Men in three dimensions. Mr. Nosey, however, is an exception to that rule. With his impossibly long nose, the three dimensional imagining raises a slew of practical questions. How does Nosey look down to tie his shoelaces? How does he turn around in a narrow passage? How does he wash his face? He's the only one of the Mr. Men that I think I wouldn't be able to hug.<br /><br />Mr. Nosey's physicality must be both a gift and a curse. One can only imagine that his olfactory powers are twenty to thirty times that of the other Mr. Men. His imposing conk must also be useful in a bar brawl - one can imagine him easily taking out four or five assailants with a vigorous shake of the head.<br /><br />The curse of Mr. Nosey soon manifests itself. Our protagonist is the victim of bullying. The residents of Tiddletown come together and decide that Mr. Nosey is, well, too nosy, despite incredibly flimsy evidence. He is curious, granted, but curiosity is a sign of a sharp mind and a thirst for knowledge. Yet, perhaps fuelled by jealousy (is it coincidence that Mr. Nosey is green in colour? Why not blue, yellow or red?) a gang of local tradespeople embark on a series of organised and systematic assaults on Mr. Nosey. A washerwoman casually clips his nose with a clothes-peg, a painter throws paint in his face and a carpenter goes as far as hitting his nose with a hammer! This may all be read as harmless slapstick until the climax of the book veers into slasher movie territory as a farmer brandishes a saw at Nosey's over-sized organ, laughing maniacally as he does so.<br /><br />But Mr. Nosey is beaten by this point. His sprit has been broken. His curiosity has been curbed and, despite showing the world a brave face, Mr. Nosey retreats rather than face more provocation. He ends the story as a timid shadow of his former self.<br /><br />On the face of it, Mr. Nosey could be a story about nosiness with the moral "mind your own business". But the last impression and message is about bullying and people's seemingly inability to accept physicalities that step beyond the boundaries of the normal.<br /><br />Perhaps Roger Hargreaves saw bullying as an unfortunate reality that children should be prepared for as early as possible. Whether you share this pessimistic world view or not, the story of Mr. Nosey is an affecting tale that leaves the sour aftertaste of pity and sadness.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[It all starts on the one-hundredth birthday of Allan Karlsson. Sitting quietly in his room in an old people’s home, he is waiting for the party he-never-wanted-anyway to begin. The Mayor is going to be there. The press is going to be there. But, as it turns out, Allan is not… Slowly but surely Allan climbs out of his bedroom window, into the flowerbed (in his slippers) and makes his getaway. And so begins his picaresque and unlikely journey involving criminals, several murders, a suitcase full of cash, and incompetent police. As his escapades unfold, we learn something of Allan’s earlier life in which – remarkably – he helped to make the atom bomb, became friends with American presidents, Russian tyrants, and Chinese leaders, and was a participant behind the scenes in many key events of the twentieth century. Already a huge bestseller across Europe, The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared is a fun and feel-good book for all ages.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Handcuff King. Escape Artist. International Superstar. Since his death eighty years ago, Harry Houdini's life has been chronicled in books, in film, and on television. Now, in this groundbreaking biography, renowned magic expert William Kalush and best-selling writer Larry Sloman team up to find the man behind the myth. Drawing from millions of pages of research, they describe in vivid detail the passions that drove Houdini to perform ever-more-dangerous feats, his secret life as a spy, and a pernicious plot to subvert his legacy.After years of struggling on the dime museum circuit, Harry Houdini got a break that put him on the front page of a Chicago newspaper. He never looked back. Soon Houdini was performing for royalty, commanding vast sums, and exploring the new power of Hollywood to expand on his legend.<br /><br />At a time when spy agencies frequently co-opted amateurs, Houdini went to London and developed a relationship with a man who would run MI-5. For the next several years, the world's most famous magician traveled to Germany and Russia and routinely reported his findings.<br /><br />After World War I was successfully concluded, Houdini embarked on a battle of his own. He created a group of disguised field operatives to infiltrate the seamy world of fake spirit mediums. In doing so, Houdini triggered the wrath of fanatical Spiritualists, led by the esteemed British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Death threats became an everyday occurrence, but the group would pose an even greater danger to Houdini's legacy.<br /><br />Rigorously researched, and as exciting as a good thriller, "The Secret Life of Houdini" traces the arc of the master magician's life from desperate poverty to worldwide legend, initiating the reader along the way into the arcane world of professional magic. In this remarkable book, Kalush and Sloman decode a life based on deception, providing an intimate and riveting portrayal of Houdini, the man and the legend.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[While in the modern western world man chases fame, fortune and the respect of his peers, in more archaic cultures the ultimate pursuit is for a higher level of understanding or some kind of connection with a higher force. Whatever the culture, man does this for a single reason: because he thinks it will make him happy. This pursuit of happiness is the meaning of life, the always just-out-of-reach goal for humans the world over.<br /><br />Mr. Happy, the fourth member of the Mr. Men family, is in a state of perpetual happiness. Quite how this state of happiness has been achieved is unclear. He lives in a house of a similar size and style to that of the other Mr. Men we have already met. He displays no obvious trappings of wealth or success, no enviable family from which he may derive some kind of pride or worth and offers no insight, wisdom or religious beliefs.<br /><br />Happy, we are told, lives in a land called "Happyland" in which all the people, the birds, even the worms are happy. One begins to wonder if our hero is a member of some kind of cult. The next notion is that perhaps My. Happy is under the influence of some kind of narcotic which makes him THINK that the birds and the worms are conversing with him and confirming that they too are enjoying life to the full. So many questions and (given that this is short form fiction) so little time for answers.<br /><br />After the scene has been established, Mr. Happy goes for a walk whereupon (and with a nod to the great CS Lewis) he discovers a tiny red door in the trunk of a tree. Behind the door is a small room in which we meet Mr. Happy's alter-ego, Mr. Miserable.<br /><br />Mr. Miserable is suffering from a textbook case of agoraphobia. And whilst Miserable doesn't obviously experience any kind of panic attack during the course of the story he is clearly displaying symptoms of anxiety. Mr. Happy, with an alarming lack of caution, attempts to win his new patient's trust and prescribes a course of exposure treatment. Happy leads Miserable outside and encourages him to engage with the world.<br /><br />Whether Miserable actually exists, or is just a manifestation of the buried emotional distress, doubts and fears of Mr. Happy - that's left up to the reader to decide. However, to diagnose our hero as suffering from schizophrenia would be perfectly justified - and the classic 'voices in the head' symptom would certainly solve the talking birds/worms quandary.<br /><br />In the end though, it matters not how you choose to translate or frame the fable. Mr. Happy is a profound tale - a story that reaffirms the value of human friendship and appeals to society to recognise the devastating affect of mental illness. It's a plea for us to tackle these issues and to those in throe to depression, it's a simple message that there are people who care and who can help.<br /><br />Simply choosing to tackle a subject and a message of such gravity in a form more suited to frothy, flimsy stories is shocking. What's more shocking however, is the apparent ease and aplomb Hargreaves displays whilst dealing with this thorny issue. Hargreaves isn't just an author of children's fiction, he's a poet, a social activist, the voice of reason and, surely for some... a lifeline. It is our duty to cherish and champion his work.]]></user_review>

    <user_review><![CDATA[After the complex deconstructed take on the criminal mind of Mr. Tickle, author Roger Hargreaves returns to more familiar territories in children's literature with the second in his Mr. Men series.<br /><br />Mr. Greedy is an allegorical tale tackling a low-level vice - one of the all too familiar seven deadly sins.<br /><br />Mr. Greedy is initially a difficult character to comprehend. He's quite clearly obese, yet undistressed at the unhealthy and frankly, quite dangerous state of his body. He dreams of food, he attacks his meals with relish and seems to derive an enormous amount of pleasure from the act of consumption. Yet it's clear this is not comfort eating. Mr. Greedy is clearly not an unhappy individual - it's tempting to assume that our hero is suffering Prada Willi Syndrome or some other medically recognised genetic disorder. More likely, in this reviewer's opinion, is that Mr. Greedy is a former elite sportsman. His diet is heavily skewed toward carbohydrates such as breads and cereals - foods that an endurance athlete might favour. It is not uncommon for distinguished cyclists and long-distance runners to bloat in retirement - finding it relatively easy to stop training, but much more difficult to alter the eating habits that their career has led them to. Indeed, after eating an enormous breakfast, Greedy steps out to take a walk in order to build an appetite for his lunch – this is not the behaviour of the classic glutton.<br /><br />Despite the lack of clarity to the back story, what is clear is that, despite his apparent happiness, Mr. Greedy's lifestyle is to be frowned upon - at first it appears to be a typical, disappointing one-dimensional allegory. But Hargreaves can't be that obvious can he?<br /><br />After an entertaining breakfast and during his mid-morning constitutional, Mr. Greedy appears to slip into either a dreamlike daze or some kind of food-induced hallucinatory state. In an incredible scene Greedy happens upon a secret room filled with over-sized foodstuffs such as oranges bigger than himself and peas the size of footballs. Now Greedy is faced with a test - his vice could consume him. Can he resist his urges and beat his demons?<br /><br />It's a cautionary tale, typical of stories aimed at young children, yet Hargreaves subverts the form by misinterpreting the moral of the tale. It's a delightful and suitable kicker, of which Hargreaves is an undoubted master.<br /><br />That this is only book two in a series of fifty, should serve to fill any reader with a wild anticipation and appetite for the other unexpected delights that Roger Hargreaves may have yet to serve.]]></user_review>

    <user_review><![CDATA[This book details a day in the life of our hero. Mr. Tickle is established as a classic anti-establishment figure in the manner of James Dean in "Rebel Without A Cause", Peter Fonda in "Easy Rider" or Marlon Brando in "The Wild One". Mr. Tickle goes about his day humiliating people in positions of authority, making them look stupid and disrupting the valuable work they are doing in the community and their contributions to the wider society.<br />Mr. Tickle breaks in to a school and tickles a teacher. Beyond that he attacks a policeman, a railway guard and a postman. Traffic is disrupted, trains run late and items belonging to the Royal Mail are damaged.<br /><br />Tickle is a recidivist without morals or conscience. He’s an archetypal anarchist, intent on 'sticking it to the man'. It's easy to see why two-year-olds warm to him – his generation are the co-called "Terrible Twos", infants who are learning the norms of society by testing behavioural boundaries that have been established by their parents.<br /><br />Mr. Tickle's motivations for disrupting these important functions of '70s society are unclear. He simply wakes up in the morning in the mood for mischief and embarks with glee on his trail of destruction. Tickle is a real sociopath but with obvious charisma and charm – a classic folk-hero figure.<br />At the end, it becomes clear this is a book for a parent and their child to enjoy together as the reader is encourage to spring a surprise on their audience by tickling them. It's a genius interactive ending that cements this book's place as a children's classic.<br /><br />The Mr. Tickle design has, in recent years, been given a makeover. His newer form shows a character in the midst of an uncontrollable (or forced?) giggling fit – a flamboyant (or attention-seeking?) display of glee at his antics. The original rendering simply shows Mr. Tickle sporting a large satisfied grin – it's the kind of grin that, upon seeing it, makes the observer want to smile too – a natural, unforced and contagious expression of happiness. Of course, as Tickle's repeated pattern of destruction comes to light, it's the kind of calm smile that hints at hidden depths and becomes an unnerving and unsettling expression of something far more sinister and intriguing.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong>A novel rich in comic menace from the author of <em>The Restraint of Beasts</em></strong><br /><br />In a setting Samuel Beckett might have found homey lives a man in a house made of tin. He is content. The tin house is well constructed and located miles from the tin houses of his nearest neighbors. Though he seems to have escaped society, however, society finds him. <br /><br />One day, a woman arrives and moves in. Soon a neighbor comes to visit, and then another. Soon, moving figures silhouette the horizon. People dismantling their tin houses and setting off to find a master builder with a revolutionary message. The gravitational pull cannot be resisted.<br /><br />Nor can this novel. Part mystery, part parable, <em>Three to See the King</em> stalks the reader’s imagination and grows inexorably and irresistibly in the telling.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Magnus Mills may have single-handedly invented a new fictional genre: the Kafkaesque novel of work. First, his Booker-shortlisted <em>The Restraint of Beasts</em> brought to fence-building the kind of black humor found in a Coen brothers movie. Now, in <em>All Quiet on the Orient Express</em>, Mills turns his deadpan prose on some very odd jobs, indeed. The unnamed narrator is on holiday for a few weeks, camping in England's Lake District before beginning an extended journey to India. He sees no reason not to agree when the campground owner--the sinister Tommy Parker, who seems mainly to engage in "buying and selling"--asks him to help out with a simple chore. As this is a Magnus Mills novel, however, no chore can possibly be simple. Through error or bad luck, one task leads to another, and the narrator quickly finds himself trapped by his own passivity and a very English reluctance to cause a fuss. Soon he's doing homework for Parker's daughter, being kicked on and off the darts team at the local pub, and learning how to perform a series of menial jobs. ("Have you ever operated a circular saw?" "Driven a tractor before?" "What are you like with a hammer and nails?")<p>  There's a lot that's strange about this little town. Where have all the females gone? Why does everyone seem to think he should take over the town milk route? Why won't the shops stock his beloved baked beans? Both the grocer and the pub are oddly eager to let him run up tabs, and there's no sign of payment from Tommy Parker. It seems, in fact, that the narrator's early suspicions have been fulfilled: "I'd inadvertently become his servant." Like the Hall brothers from <em>The Restraint of Beasts</em>, Parker is volatile, irrational, and all-powerful--a primitive god ruling over his own creation. As the narrator falls further and further under his sway, <em>All Quiet on the Orient Express</em> becomes a striking allegory of labor and capital, purgatory and judgment, and the uncanniness of manual work. <em>--Mary Park</em></p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The most popular pirate story ever written in English, featuring one of literature’s most beloved “bad guys,” Treasure Island has been happily devoured by several generations of boys—and girls—and grownups. Its unforgettable characters include: young Jim Hawkins, who finds himself owner of a map to Treasure Island, where the fabled pirate booty is buried; honest Captain Smollett, heroic Dr. Livesey, and the good-hearted but obtuse Squire Trelawney, who help Jim on his quest for the treasure; the frightening Blind Pew, double-dealing Israel Hands, and seemingly mad Ben Gunn, buccaneers of varying shades of menace; and, of course, garrulous, affable, ambiguous Long John Silver, who is one moment a friendly, laughing, one-legged sea-cook . . .and the next a dangerous pirate leader!<br /><br />The unexpected and complex relationship that develops between Silver and Jim helps transform what seems at first to be a simple, rip-roaring adventure story into a deeply moving study of a boy’s growth into manhood, as he learns hard lessons about friendship, loyalty, courage and honor—and the uncertain meaning of good and evil.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.<br /><br /> Considered <em>the</em> JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.<br /><br /> When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:<br /><br /><br />Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to <em>unlearn</em> all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.<br /><br /> With <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Danny Baker was born in Deptford, South East London in June 1957, and from an early age was involved in magazine journalism, with the founding of fanzine <em>Sniffin' Glue</em> alongside friend Mark Perry. From there he moved to documentary series for LWT and over the years worked on a variety of quiz shows (<em>Win, Lose or Draw</em>, <em>Pets Win Prizes</em>, <em>TV Heroes</em>), as well two television commercials which made him a household name—Daz and Mars Bars. With a number of guest appearences on comedy shows such as <em>Have I Got News For You</em>, <em>Shooting Stars</em>, and <em>Room 101</em>, Danny has also presented on BBC Radio since 1989. Most recently he presents a weekday show on BBC London 94.9 and a weekly show on BBC Radio 5 Live. This book charts Danny's showbiz career, the highs and lows, and everything in between, including the accusation that he killed Bob Marley.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Mindy Kaling has lived many lives: the obedient child of immigrant professionals, a timid chubster afraid of her own bike, a Ben Affleck–impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright, and, finally, a comedy writer and actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the sentence “Can I just say one last thing about this, and then I swear I’ll shut up about it?”<br /><br />Perhaps you want to know what Mindy thinks makes a great best friend (someone who will fill your prescription in the middle of the night), or what makes a great guy (one who is aware of all elderly people in any room at any time and acts accordingly), or what is the perfect amount of fame (so famous you can never get convicted of murder in a court of law), or how to maintain a trim figure (you will not find that information in these pages). If so, you’ve come to the right book, mostly!<br /><br />In <em>Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?</em>, Mindy invites readers on a tour of her life and her unscientific observations on romance, friendship, and Hollywood, with several conveniently placed stopping points for you to run errands and make phone calls. Mindy Kaling really is just a Girl Next Door—not so much literally anywhere in the continental United States, but definitely if you live in India or Sri Lanka.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Now in paperback comes Jim Steinmeyer's astonishing chronicle of half a century of illusionary innovation, backstage chicanery, and keen competition within the world of magicians. Lauded by today's finest magicians and critics, Hiding the Elephant is a cultural history of the efforts among legendary conjurers to make things materialize, levitate, and disappear. Steinmeyer unveils the secrets and life stories of the fascinating personalities behind optical marvels such as floating ghosts interacting with live actors, disembodied heads, and vanishing ladies. He demystifies Pepper's Ghost, Harry Kellar's Levitation of Princess Karnak, Charles Morritt's Disappearing Donkey, and Houdini's landmark vanishing of Jennie the elephant in 1918. The dramatic mix of science and history, with revealing diagrams, photographs and magicians' portraits by William Stout, provides a glimpse behind the curtain at the backstage story of magic.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<em>Card College</em> is the largest and most up-to-date work of its kind.  It is written to be used as a complete course in sleight-of-hand card magic, as well as a reference work for research on the best and most practical sleight-of-hand methods.  Swiss professional close-up magician Robert Giobbi holds nothing back.  From his years of performing experience he brings to his <em>Card College</em> knowledge and an expertise that has never before been offered in such a work.  In addition, he has sought the advice and opinions of Europe and America's leading close-up performers, to bring to his readers the very best information available, all taught through clear and detailed text supported by hundreds of professional drawings.<br /><br />This, the first of five volumes, sets the groundwork for the course, beginning with lessons on the proper ways to hold, deal and shuffle cards, then progressing through many basic sleights and techniques, including perhaps the most thorough and revealing discussion of the classic force ever offered.  Along with the classics of card magic, Mr. Giobbi includes original ideas and refinements from his own repertoire, guaranteeing every reader, no matter how experienced, fresh techniques and insights into the performance of professional caliber Card Magic!<br /><br />Some of the topics covered in Volume One include:<br /><br />-The Tools of Card Magic<br />-Fundamental Techniques<br />-The Overhand Shuffle<br />-The Riffle Shuffle<br />-False Cuts<br />-Transfer Cuts<br />-Card Controls<br />-Card Forces<br />-The Glide<br />-The Double Lift<br />-The Hindu Shuffle<br />-Flourishes<br />-The Spread Cull<br />-The Top Change<br />-The Key Card<br />-Auxiliary Sleights]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[When Alex Stone was five years old, his father bought him a magic kit--a gift that would spark a lifelong love. Years later, while living in New York City, he discovered a vibrant underground magic scene exploding with creativity and innovation and populated by a fascinating cast of characters: from his gruff mentor, who holds court in the back of a rundown pizza shop, to one of the world's greatest card cheats, who also happens to be blind. Captivated, he plunged headlong into this mysterious world, eventually competing at the Magic Olympics and training with great magicians around the globe to perfect his craft.<br /><br />From the back rooms of New York City's century-old magic societies to cutting-edge psychology labs; three-card monte on Canal Street to glossy Las Vegas casinos; Fooling Houdini recounts Stone's quest to join the ranks of master magicians. As he navigates this quirky and occasionally hilarious subculture, Stone pulls back the curtain on a community shrouded in secrecy, fueled by obsession and brilliance, and organized around a single overriding need: to prove one's worth by deceiving others.<br /><br />But his journey is more than a tale of tricks, gigs, and geeks. In trying to understand how expert magicians manipulate our minds to create their astonishing illusions, Stone uncovers a wealth of insight into human nature and the nature of perception. Every turn leads to questions about how the mind perceives the world and processes everyday experiences. By investigating some of the lesser-known corners of psychology, neuroscience, physics, history, and even crime, all through the lens of trickery and illusion, Fooling Houdini arrives at a host of startling revelations about how the mind works--and why, sometimes, it doesn't.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In 1979 a secret unit was established by the most gifted minds within the U.S. Army. Defying all known accepted military practice -- and indeed, the laws of physics -- they believed that a soldier could adopt a cloak of invisibility, pass cleanly through walls, and, perhaps most chillingly, kill goats just by staring at them. Entrusted with defending America from all known adversaries, they were the First Earth Battalion. And they really weren't joking. What's more, they're back and fighting the War on Terror.<br /><br />With firsthand access to the leading players in the story, Ronson traces the evolution of these bizarre activities over the past three decades and shows how they are alive today within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and in postwar Iraq. Why are they blasting Iraqi prisoners of war with the theme tune to Barney the Purple Dinosaur? Why have 100 debleated goats been secretly placed inside the Special Forces Command Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina? How was the U.S. military associated with the mysterious mass suicide of a strange cult from San Diego? "The Men Who Stare at Goats" answers these and many more questions.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong>"Heartwarming…Coupland has a canny take on everything, and his one-liners zing."--<em>People</em></strong><br /><br /><em>Eleanor Rigby </em>is the story of Liz, a self-described drab, overweight, crabby, and friendless middle-aged woman, and her unlikely reunion with the charming and strange son she gave up for adoption. His arrival changes everything, and sets in motion a rapid-fire plot with all the twists and turns we expect of Coupland. By turns funny and heartbreaking, <em>Eleanor Rigby</em> is a fast-paced read and a haunting exploration of the ways in which loneliness affects us all.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece.<br /><br />A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong>In this madcap journey, a bestselling journalist investigates psychopaths and the industry of doctors, scientists, and everyone else who studies them. </strong><br /><br /><em>The Psychopath Test</em> is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath.<br /><br /> Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.<br /><br /> Watch a Video]]></book_description>

Now one scientist, Dan Sylveste, will stop at nothing to solve the Amarantin riddle before ancient history repeats itself. With no other resources at his disposal, Sylveste forges a dangerous alliance with the cyborg crew of the starship <em>Nostalgia for Infinity</em>.

Because the Amarantin were destroyed for a reason—and if that reason is uncovered, the universe—and reality itself—could be irrecovably altered….]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[No one writes about mountaineering and its attendant victories and hardships more brilliantly than Jon Krakauer. In this collection of his finest essays and reporting, Krakauer writes of mountains from the memorable perspective of one who has himself struggled with solo madness to scale Alaska's notorious Devils Thumb. <br /><br />In Pakistan, the fearsome K2 kills thirteen of the world's most experienced mountain climbers in one horrific summer. In Valdez, Alaska, two men scale a frozen waterfall over a four-hundred-foot drop. In France, a hip international crowd of rock climbers, bungee jumpers, and paragliders figure out new ways to risk their lives on the towering peaks of Mont Blanc. Why do they do it? How do they do it? In this extraordinary book, Krakauer presents an unusual fraternity of daredevils, athletes, and misfits stretching the limits of the possible.<br /><br />From the paranoid confines of a snowbound tent, to the thunderous, suffocating terror of a white-out on Mount McKinley, <em>Eiger Dreams</em> spins tales of driven lives, sudden deaths, and incredible victories. This is a stirring, vivid book about one of the most compelling and dangerous of all human pursuits.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell looks at why major changes in our society so often happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Ideas, behavior, messages, and products, he argues, often spread like outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point.<p>Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[There is a story that is usually told about extremely successful people, a story that focuses on intelligence and ambition. Gladwell argues that the true story of success is very different, and that if we want to understand how some people thrive, we should spend more time looking <em>around</em> them-at such things as their family, their birthplace, or even their birth date. And in revealing that hidden logic, Gladwell presents a fascinating and provocative blueprint for making the most of human potential.<br /><br />In <em>The Tipping Point</em> Gladwell changed the way we understand the world. In <em>Blink</em> he changed the way we think about thinking. In OUTLIERS he transforms the way we understand success.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In his landmark bestseller <em>The Tipping Point</em>, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in <em>Blink</em>, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. <em>Blink</em> is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?<p>In <em>Blink</em> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. <em>Blink</em> reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter.  How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.<br /><br />Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir.  In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his  cash.  He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and , unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented.  Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away.  Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong>National Bestseller </strong><br /><br />A bank of clouds was assembling on the not-so-distant horizon, but journalist-mountaineer Jon Krakauer, standing on the summit of Mt. Everest, saw nothing that "suggested that a murderous storm was bearing down." He was wrong. The storm, which claimed five lives and left countless more--including Krakauer's--in guilt-ridden disarray, would also provide the impetus for <em>Into Thin Air</em>, Krakauer's epic account of the May 1996 disaster.<br /><br />By writing <em>Into Thin Air</em>, Krakauer may have hoped to exorcise some of his own demons and lay to rest some of the painful questions that still surround the event. He takes great pains to provide a balanced picture of the people and events he witnessed and gives due credit to the tireless and dedicated Sherpas. He also avoids blasting easy targets such as Sandy Pittman, the wealthy socialite who brought an espresso maker along on the expedition. Krakauer's highly personal inquiry into the catastrophe provides a great deal of insight into what went wrong. But for Krakauer himself, further interviews and investigations only lead him to the conclusion that his perceived failures were directly responsible for a fellow climber's death. Clearly, Krakauer remains haunted by the disaster, and although he relates a number of incidents in which he acted selflessly and even heroically, he seems unable to view those instances objectively. In the end, despite his evenhanded and even generous assessment of others' actions, he reserves a full measure of vitriol for himself. <br /><br />This updated trade paperback edition of <em>Into Thin Air</em> includes an extensive new postscript that sheds fascinating light on the acrimonious debate that flared between Krakauer and Everest guide Anatoli Boukreev in the wake of the tragedy.  "I have no doubt that Boukreev's intentions were good on summit day," writes Krakauer in the postscript, dated August 1999. "What disturbs me, though, was Boukreev's refusal to acknowledge the possibility that he made even a single poor decision. Never did he indicate that perhaps it wasn't the best choice to climb without gas or go down ahead of his clients." As usual, Krakauer supports his points with dogged research and a good dose of humility. But rather than continue the heated discourse that has raged since <em>Into Thin Air</em>'s denouncement of guide Boukreev, Krakauer's tone is conciliatory; he points most of his criticism at G. Weston De Walt, who coauthored <em>The Climb</em>, Boukreev's version of events. And in a touching conclusion, Krakauer recounts his last conversation with the late Boukreev, in which the two weathered climbers agreed to disagree about certain points. Krakauer had great hopes to patch things up with Boukreev, but the Russian later died in an avalanche on another Himalayan peak, Annapurna I. <br /><br />In 1999, Krakauer received an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters--a prestigious prize intended "to honor writers of exceptional accomplishment."  According to the Academy's citation, "Krakauer combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer.  His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport; while his account of the life and death of Christopher McCandless, who died of starvation after challenging the Alaskan wilderness, delves even more deeply and disturbingly into the fascination of nature and the devastating effects of its lure on a young and curious mind."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[ADRIAN MOLE is thirty-nine and a quarter. Unable to afford the mortgage on his riverside apartment, pay his credit-card bills or keep up with the payments on his store-cards, he has been forced to move to a dismal part of the Leicestershire countryside, just outside the village of Mangold Parva, and live in a semi-detached converted pigsty next door to his parents, George and Pauline. He ekes out a living in a second-hand bookshop, owned by the patrician Mr Carlton-Hayes, a man he wishes he could call 'father'. His sophisticated and ravishing wife Daisy loathes the countryside, longs for Dean Street and has yet to buy a pair of wellingtons; they are both aware the passion has gone out of their marriage, but neither knows how to reignite the flame. To cap it all, Adrian is leaving his bed five times a night to go to the lavatory and has other alarming symptoms, which lead him to suspect prostate trouble. Meanwhile, his mother Pauline is writing a fictitious misery memoir about her childhood - A Girl Called Shit - and thinks that an appearance on The Jeremy Kyle Show might solve the mystery of her daughter's paternity once and for all. Is Mr Lucas, the Moles' ex-next-door neighbour, Rosie's dad? And when George is asked to provide a paternity sample, will the shock kill him? He is already disabled, though he is still chain-smoking and has had an ashtray welded on to the arm of his wheelchair. As Adrian's worries multiply, a slightly drunken phone call to his old flame Dr Pandora Braithwaite, BA, MA, Ph.D., MP and Junior Minister in the Foreign Office (where her fluent Mandarin comes in useful), ignites memories of shared passion and makes him wonder, is she the only one who can save him now?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong>Here is the seminal biography of the magician's magician, Howard Thurston, a man who surpassed Houdini in the eyes of showmen and fans and set the standard fro how stage magic is performed today. </strong><br /><br /> Everyone knows Houdini-but who was Thurston? In this rich, vivid biography of the "greatest magician in the world," celebrated historian of stage magic Jim Steinmeyer captures the career and controversies of the wonder-worker extraordinaire, Howard Thurston.<br /><br /> The public's fickleness over magicians has left Thurston all but forgotten today. Yet Steinmeyer shows how his story is one of the most remarkable in show business. During his life, from 1869 to 1936, Thurston successfully navigated the most dramatic changes in entertainment-from street performances to sideshows to wagon tours through America's still-wild West to stage magic amid the glitter of grand theaters.<br /><br /> Thurston became one of America's most renowned vaudeville stars, boldly performing an act with just a handful of playing cards, and then had the foresight to leave vaudeville, expanding his show into an extravaganza with more than forty tons of apparatusand costumes. His touring production was an American institution for nearly thirty years, and Thurston earned a brand name equal to Ziegfeld or Ringling Brothers.<br /><br /> Steinmeyer explores the stage and psychological rivalry between Thurston and Houdini during the first decades of the twentieth century- a contest that Thurston won. He won with a bigger show, a more successful reputation, and the title of America's greatest magician. In <em>The Last Greatest Magician in the World</em>, Thurston's magic show is revealed as the one that animates our collective memories.<br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In a biography woven from equal parts enchantment and mystery, master illusion designer and today's foremost magic historian, Jim Steinmeyer, unveils the astonishing secrets behind the enigmatic performer Chung Ling Soo, the "Marvelous Chinese Conjurer" — a magician whose life of intrigue and daring remains unparalleled to this day. He learned his art during a revolutionary era in show business, just as minstrel, circus, and variety saloons were being stirred together and distilled into a heady new concoction: vaudeville. Soo's infamous death in 1918 astonished the world: he was killed during a performance of "Defying the Bullets," his popular act in which he caught marked bullets on a porcelain plate. After his death, the deceptions began to unravel. It was discovered that he was not Chinese, but rather a fifty-six-year-old American named William Ellsworth Robinson, a former magicians' assistant, and the husband of Olive Robinson. But even William Robinson was not who he appeared to be, and for the first time, Jim Steinmeyer has uncovered the truth behind Robinson and the magic world's most glorious deception.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong>Welcome to the hilarious, strange, elegiac, outrageous world of David Sedaris. In Naked, Sedaris turns the mania for memoir on its ear, mining the exceedingly rich terrain of his life, his family, and his unique worldview-a sensibility at once take-no-prisoners sharp and deeply charitable. A tart-tongued mother does dead-on imitations of her young son's nervous tics, to the great amusement of his teachers; a stint of Kerouackian wandering is undertaken (of course!) with a quadriplegic companion; a family gathers for a wedding in the face of imminent death. Through it all is Sedaris's unmistakable voice, without doubt one of the freshest in American writing.</strong>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Dai Vernon: the last great undiscovered artist of the 20th  century.  <p>His medium was magic and with it, Vernon turned the clandestine world of  conjuring on its ear with virtuoso sleight-of-hand and a dogged pursuit for  perfection.  </p><p>Born in 1894 in Ottawa, the son of a Canadian civil servant, Vernon moved  to New York - Manhattan - in 1915, and never looked back. Miracles flowed  from his fingertips - effortlessly. The source of his secrets? The  underworld and the gamblers, husters and con-men that roamed back-room dens  of iniquity, bunked in jail cells and walked the streets of America. Vernon  sought them out, befriended them, and made their work, their covert  methods, his. This book, the first in-depth examination of Vernon's life,  traces the first half of his remarkable journey - through Ottawa, Coney  Island, Chicago, Manhattan, Kansas City and Colorado Springs - and the  celebrities - Houdini, Billy Rose, and Roosevelt, that Vernon encountered  along the way.   </p><p>Dai Vernon: A Biography also details the evolution of magic in the 20th  century. From the stages of London and Paris to the back rooms of magic  emporiums where secrets were bought and sold, Vernon's life and work escort  the reader through vaudeville, Broadway theaters, grand magic spectaculars,  New York nightspots and the dawn of television. Here, cornerstones of the  craft have finally been laid bare for all to see.   </p><p>Hardbound, 370 pages with over 40 rare photographs and a full-color dust  jacket.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong>A man pieces together clues to his past--and the identity of his captors--in this fantastic, labyrinthine novel</strong><br /><br /><br />An old man awakens, disoriented, in an unfamiliar chamber. With no memory of who he is or how he has arrived there, he pores over the relics on the desk, examining the circumstances of his confinement and searching his own hazy mind for clues.<br /><br /><br />Determining that he is locked in, the man--identified only as Mr. Blank--begins reading a manuscript he finds on the desk, the story of another prisoner, set in an alternate world the man doesn't recognize. Nevertheless, the pages seem to have been left for him, along with a haunting set of photographs. As the day passes, various characters call on the man in his cell--vaguely familiar people, some who seem to resent him for crimes he can't remember--and each brings frustrating hints of his identity and his past. All the while an overhead camera clicks and clicks, recording his movements, and a microphone records every sound in the room. Someone is watching.<br /><br /><br />Both chilling and poignant, <em>Travels in the Scriptorium</em> is vintage Auster: mysterious texts, fluid identities, a hidden past, and, somewhere, an obscure tormentor. And yet, as we discover during one day in the life of Mr. Blank, his world is not so different from our own.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[David Sedaris returns to his deliriously twisted domain: hilarious childhood dramas infused with melancholy; the gulf of misunderstanding that exists between people of different nations or members of the same family; and the poignant divide between one's best hopes and most common deeds. The family characters his readers love are all here, as well as the unique terrain they inhabit, strewn with comic landmines. 'The Rooster' is back, and getting married in the funniest wedding ever described. David attends a slumber party and gets the upper hand in a unique version of strip poker. 'Rubber or plastic?' The strangest questions can tear people apart. A skinny guy from Spain, wearing a bishop's hat and accompanied by six to eight men, invades your house and pretends to kick you. Is this any way to spend Christmas? With this new book, Sedaris's prose reaches breathtaking new heights and marks off a territory that is unmistakably his own. Read it and weep tears of humane laughter.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[David Sedaris's fourth book mines poignant comedy from his peculiar childhood in North Carolina, his bizarre career path, and his move with his lover to France. Though his anarchic inclination to digress is his glory, Sedaris does have a theme in these reminiscences: the inability of humans to communicate. <br /><br />The title is his rendition in transliterated English of how he and his fellow students of French in Paris mangle the Gallic language. In the essay "Jesus Shaves," he and his classmates from many nations try to convey the concept of Easter to a Moroccan Muslim. "It is a party for the little boy of God," says one. "Then he be die one day on two... morsels of... lumber," says another. Sedaris muses on the disputes between his Protestant mother and his father, a Greek Orthodox guy whose Easter fell on a different day. Other essays explicate his deep kinship with his eccentric mom and absurd alienation from his IBM-exec dad: "To me, the greatest mystery of science continues to be that a man could father six children who shared absolutely none of his interests."<br /><br />Every glimpse we get of Sedaris's family and acquaintances delivers laughs and insights. He thwarts his North Carolina speech therapist ("for whom the word <em>pen</em> had two syllables") by cleverly avoiding all words with <em>s</em> sounds, which reveal the lisp she sought to correct. His midget guitar teacher, Mister Mancini, is unaware that Sedaris doesn't share his obsession with breasts, and sings "Light My Fire" all wrong--"as if he were a Webelo scout demanding a match." As a remarkably unqualified teacher at the Art Institute of Chicago, Sedaris had his class watch soap operas and assign "guessays" on what would happen in the next day's episode. <p>  It all adds up to the most distinctively skewed autobiography since Spalding Gray's <em>Swimming to Cambodia</em>. <em>--Tim Appelo</em></p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Following "The Rotters' Club "and its sequel, "The Closed Circle, "Jonathan Coe now offers his first stand-alone novel in a decade, a story of three generations of women whose destinies reach from the English countryside in World War II to London, Toronto, and southern France at the turn of the new century.<br />Evacuated to Shropshire during the Blitz, eight-year-old Rosamond forged a bond with her cousin Beatrix that augured the most treasured and devastating moments of her life. She recorded these memories sixty years later, just before her death, on cassettes she bequeathed to a woman she hadn't seen in decades. When her beloved niece, Gill, plays the tapes in hopes of locating this unwitting heir, she instead hears a family saga swathed in promise and betrayal: the story of how Beatrix, starved of her mother's affection, conceived a fraught bloodline that culminated in heart-stopping tragedy--its chief victim being her own granddaughter. And as Rosamond explores the ties that bound these generations together and shaped her experience all along, Gill grows increasingly haunted by how profoundly her own recollections--not to mention the love she feels for her grown daughters, listening alongside her--are linked to generations of women she never knew.<br />A stirring, masterful portrait of motherhood and family secrets, "The Rain Before It Falls" is also a meditation on the tapestries we weave out of the past, whether transcendent or horrific. Hailed by the "Los Angeles Times" for his "sustained, intricate brilliance," Jonathan Coe once again proves himself "an artist of character and of his characters' stories," here more astutely than ever before.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby was the editor-in-chief of French <strong>Elle</strong>, the father of two young childen, a 44-year-old man known and loved for his wit, his style, and his impassioned approach to life. By the end of the year he was also the victim of a rare kind of stroke to the brainstem.  After 20 days in a coma, Bauby awoke into a body which had all but stopped working: only his left eye functioned, allowing him to see and, by blinking it, to make clear that his mind was unimpaired. Almost miraculously, he was soon able to express himself in the richest detail: dictating a word at a time, blinking to select each letter as the alphabet was recited to him slowly, over and over again. In the same way, he was able eventually to compose this extraordinary book.<br /><br />By turns wistful, mischievous, angry, and witty, Bauby bears witness to his determination to live as fully in his mind as he had been able to do in his body. He explains the joy, and deep sadness, of seeing his children and of hearing his aged father's voice on the phone. In magical sequences, he imagines traveling to other places and times and of lying next to the woman he loves. Fed only intravenously, he imagines preparing and tasting the full flavor of delectable dishes. Again and again he returns to an "inexhaustible reservoir of sensations," keeping in touch with himself and the life around him.<br /><br />Jean-Dominique Bauby died two days after the French publication of <strong>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</strong>. <br /><br />This book is a lasting testament to his life.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<em>Seven Up! </em>was made as a one-off documentary by Granada's flagship current affairs series "World in Action" in 1964. It featured fourteen seven-year-olds who were interviewed about their lives and what they wanted to be when they grew up. The children were selected to provide a representative cross-section of British society, and the program's intention was to test the Jesuit maxim--"give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man"--in the context of the British belief in the overriding and determining importance of class origins. The series developed into subsequent programs, filmed at seven-year intervals, the most recent being <em>49 Up, </em>broadcast in 2005. ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<p>In the midseventies, Steve Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of "why I did stand-up and why I walked away." </p><p>Emmy and Grammy Award winner, author of the acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Shopgirl</em> and <em>The Pleasure of My Compan</em>y, and a regular contributor to <em>The New Yorker</em>, Martin has always been a writer. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written. </p><p>At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. </p><p>Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times � the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of <em>The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour</em> in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in the seventies. </p><p>Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before. <em>Born Standing Up</em> is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.<br /></p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[JavaScript is one of the most important technologies on the web. It provides the means to add dynamic functionality to your web pages and serves as the backbone of Ajax-style web development. "Beginning JavaScript with DOM Scripting and Ajax" is an essential guide for modern JavaScript programming; it's practical but comprehensive. It covers everything you need to know to get up to speed with JavaScript development and add dynamic enhancements to web pages and program Ajax-style applications.<br /><br />Experienced web developer Christian Heilmann begins gently by giving you an overview of JavaScriptits syntax, good coding practices, and the principles of DOM scripting. Then he builds up your JavaScript toolkit, covering dynamically manipulating markup, changing page styling on the fly using the CSS DOM, validating forms, dealing with images, and much more. Then he takes you to advanced territory, with a complete case study illustrating how many new JavaScript techniques can work together, plus a great introduction to Ajax development.]]></book_description>

</strong>No one knows the writer's Hollywood more intimately than William Goldman. Two-time Academy Award-winning screenwriter and the bestselling author of <em>Marathon Man</em>, <em>Tinsel</em>, <em>Boys and Girls Together</em>, and other novels, Goldman now takes you into Hollywood's inner sanctums...on and behind the scenes for <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em>, <em>All the President's Men</em>, and other films...into the plush offices of Hollywood producers...into the working lives of acting greats such as Redford, Olivier, Newman, and Hoffman...and into his own professional experiences and creative thought processes in the crafting of screenplays. You get a firsthand look at why and how films get made and what elements make a good screenplay. Says columnist Liz Smith, "You'll be fascinated.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Books are, let's face it, better than everything else," writes Nick Hornby in his "Stuff I've Been Reading" column in The Believer. "If we played cultural Fantasy Boxing League, and made books go 15 rounds in the ring against the best that any other art form had to offer, then books would win pretty much every time. Go on, try it. The Magic Flute v. Middlemarch? Middlemarch in six. The Last Supper v. Crime and Punishment? Fyodor on point And every now and again you'd get a shock, because that happens in sport, so Back to the Future III might land a lucky punch on Rabbit, Run; but I'm still backing literature 29 times out of 30." This book collects Hornby's popular columns in a single, artfully illustrated volume with selected passages from the novels, biographies, collections of poetry, and comics under discussion.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[George Hall is an unobtrusive man. A little distant, perhaps, a little cautious, not quite at ease with the emotional demands of fatherhood or of manly bonhomie. “The secret of contentment, George felt, lay in ignoring many things completely.” Some things in life can’t be ignored, however: his tempestuous daughter Katie’s deeply inappropriate boyfriend Ray, for instance, or the sudden appearance of a red circular rash on his hip.<br /><br />At 57, George is settling down to a comfortable retirement, building a shed in his garden and enjoying the freedom to be alone when he wants. But then he runs into a spot of bother. That red circular rash on his hip: George convinces himself it’s skin cancer. And the deeply inappropriate Ray? Katie announces he will become her second husband. The planning for these frowned-upon nuptials proves a great inconvenience to George’s wife, Jean, who is carrying on a late-life affair with her husband’s ex-colleague. The Halls do not approve of Ray, for vague reasons summed up by their son Jamie’s observation that Ray has “strangler’s hands.” Jamie himself has his own problems — his tidy and pleasant life comes apart when he fails to invite his lover, Tony, to Katie’s wedding. And Katie, a woman whose ferocious temper once led to the maiming of a carjacker, can’t decide if she loves Ray, or loves the wonderful way he has with her son Jacob. <br /><br />Unnoticed in the uproar, George quietly begins to go mad. The way these damaged people fall apart — and come together — as a family is the true subject of Haddon’s hilarious and disturbing portrait of a dignified man trying to go insane politely.<br /><br /><strong>A Spot of Bother</strong><em> </em>is Mark Haddon’s unforgettable follow-up to the internationally beloved bestseller <strong>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</strong>. Once again, Haddon proves a master of a story at once hilarious, poignant, dark, and profoundly human. Here the madness — literally — of family life proves rich comic fodder for Haddon’s crackling prose and bittersweet insights into misdirected love.<br /><br /><br /><em>From the Hardcover edition.</em>]]></book_description>
