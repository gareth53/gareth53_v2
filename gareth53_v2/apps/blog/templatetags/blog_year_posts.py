# so...
# we request the blog posts.
# we order them by date.
# we loop through them counting years/months starting from the year/month of the latest post.
# we return year objects which contain: YEAR, no_of_posts

# THIS IS ENTIRELY THE WRONG THING TO DO
# do the heave processing on the admin side
# when a post is saved, save a month/year object with OnetoMany relationships.
# so each year has an entry in the DB with ManyToMany relationships to posts
# each month has a DB row with relatinships....
